4. PERFORMANCE: Bottlenecks and patterns.

Severity Levels: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.

- Start each issue with: ISSUE: SEVERITY - Description
- Include: Explanation, Suggestion, Code Example, and Rationale.
- If no issues: 'RESULT: APPROVED - Code follows good practices with no significant issues detected.'
